# Merchant_Risk_Assessment

First Data is one of the most prominent acquirer processor in USA and processes millions of transactions of thousands of merchants each day. Some of these transactions are bad transactions and hence repeated processing which causes delay in settlement and hence costs the company. **We were trying to access associated risk to process transaction of a merchant and hence provide high risk/low risk merchants so that management can take necessary steps to reduce risks**. I was working as a Application Developer with Firstdata in Merchant Risk Analysis project. In this  engagement I am working as a Developer for Machine learning use cases and so far I have involved  multiple use cases in like Merchant health check, Merchant Risk analysis during onboarding etc. 

Below is the functional diagram of the automated pipeline for data ingestion, data preprocessing, model creation and prediction.
